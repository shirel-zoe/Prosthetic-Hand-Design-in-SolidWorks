# ðŸ¦¾ Prosthetic Hand Design in SolidWorks

This project is a mechanical design of a functional **prosthetic hand**, created using SolidWorks with a focus on anatomical accuracy, joint articulation, and realistic motion. The goal was to simulate the biomechanics of a human hand through CAD modeling, using proper constraints, mechanical mates, and design for manufacturability.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Software**: SolidWorks 2024  
- **Category**: Biomedical CAD Design  
- **Focus**: Functional hand design with moving joints and motion simulation  
- **Type**: Resume/Portfolio Project  

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- Modeled anatomically inspired finger joints (MCP, PIP, DIP) and thumb with two degrees of freedom  
- Designed a palm base to anchor finger segments and allow ergonomic layout  
- Applied **mechanical mates and joint limits** to simulate realistic movement  
- Built a full **motion study** for hand articulation  
- Generated **exploded views**, **technical drawings**, and **rendered images** for documentation and presentation

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Part modeling and assembly creation in SolidWorks  
- Motion simulation using mates and joint limits  
- Design principles related to ergonomics and human anatomy  
- Preparing CAD projects for presentation with drawing sheets and renders
